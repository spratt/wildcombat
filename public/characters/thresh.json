Born without the traditional Ketra connection to any specific grove, they've made the open sea their home. Their cabin is filled with charts, weather instruments, and an impressive collection of bottled storm-essence. Thresh speaks in nautical metaphors and has an uncanny ability to predict weather patterns by taste alone."
