Once a treasure hunter in the deep groves, she discovered her calling in healing when she lost her diving partner to a salvage accident. Her medical kit contains both traditional Ardent remedies and scavenged surgical tools. Despite her serious profession, she maintains the Ardent love of passionate debate and strong opinions about everything from proper suturing techniques to the best way to prepare tea."
