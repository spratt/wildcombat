    "notes": "Nova is a Cacophony whose crystalline body resonates with musical tones that can shatter glass or soothe savage beasts. Growing up as a Shankling, they learned to harmonize with the forest's natural rhythms before taking to the sea. As a Spit-Lyre, they use their sonic abilities both in performance and combat, their body singing with different frequencies depending on their mood. Their crystalline features catch and refract light, creating beautiful prismatic displays during their performances."
