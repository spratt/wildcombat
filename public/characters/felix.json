    "notes": "Felix is a young Tzelicrae whose spider-like features are more pronounced than most of their kin. Born on a reef-spit settlement, they learned to fight dirty and think fast when pirates raided their home. Now they've embraced the corsair life, using their natural climbing abilities and web-spinning to board enemy vessels. Their eight eyes give them excellent peripheral vision, and they're known for their acrobatic fighting style that makes full use of the ship's rigging."
