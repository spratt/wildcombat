  "description": "The Thornback Beetle is a heavily armored creature that roams the lower reaches of the Wildsea. Its dark green carapace is covered in wicked thorns that can pierce through leather and even light metal. When threatened, it tucks its head low and charges with surprising speed, using its horn and spines as weapons. Despite its aggressive nature, the beetle is primarily a scavenger that feeds on fallen fruit and decaying wood.",
